ðŸ–¨  MindfulPages is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to be 
your personal journaling oasis, allowing users to capture their thoughts, 
reflections, and daily musings in a simple and accessible way. 

My process for developing this web app was pretty straightforward, although not easy. 
I decided to stick with my original idea of an online journaling app, taking my main inspiration from Notion. 
- It has the main functionality (is installable) and its own icons that I made using MidJourney. 
(I might change them later to fit the design better). I had a few ideas in mind in terms of the functionality 
for this app: "Some of the key features include user authentication, entry creation and editing,
 and media integration (potentially an export and share option, searching, and reminders)." which was a bit
 of an ambitious goal (as correctly pointed in class). 

 I spent a lot of time on User Experience design, which resulted in the app lacking some of the planned
 functionality, unfortunately. It's definitely in future plans though to fix it so that a user is able to 
 save and retrieve their past entries, as well as edit them and add images.
