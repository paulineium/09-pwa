## Overview

Debugging on mobile devices can be difficult because the small screen size and lack of traditional keyboard, among other things. So we usually tether our devices to a laptop or desktop via USB and watch the console there. Here's how to set that up on both iOS and Android. I have tested this on iOS, but not on Android though, so please let me know ASAP if this is working or not for the latter.

### Part 1: Connecting to a local web page on mobile

Before you deploy your site, you'll need to visit it on your mobile device as you're building it. To do so, you have to do a few things:

1. Make sure your mobile device and computer are on the same wifi network. 
2. Find the IP address of your computer (in MacOS, it's in System Preferences > Network)
3. Launch Live Server in VS Code or run nodemon in the folder you want to serve.
4. Visit the IP address of your computer in your mobile device's web browser, typically `http://192.168.1.XXX:<port>` where `<port>` is the port number your site is being served on.

Here's a demo [video](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__nyu.zoom.us_rec_share_Avkvx4bvoqbDsULNUo9rknc7Ne06YM-5FHdtnuWZi8EJALTA0aZ2-2DXkjVXx949Vd5b.aaXYqLEXa6CTpDey-3Fpwd-3DnqOyLWTQKPo0LZHWaFjfHk8EhpJ-2DA3NK&d=DwMFAw&c=slrrB7dE8n7gBJbeO0g-IQ&r=wTFzgo36J-q7d-kMhnr2bg&m=37JwvsPN_g0SiYCZFqtfVCWgvvZBSkkozYEZgpp0bKIwYL6mGn9wBr4lPe9RS8LQ&s=kjmiyb7mepqW3oPObL72nQ_TCu5T4s5j91yfV4Jk_XA&e=) of the setup process in action.
