Adapted from the [Socket.io Chat Example Tutorial](https://socket.io/docs/v4/tutorial/introduction)

This tutorial begins by setting up:
- a static file server in Express.js
- an HTTP server in Node.js
- a Socket.io server 

From there we build out the following functionality:
- a client chat interface
- sending and receiving messages
- storing and recalling message history
- sending and receiving data like images
    - can be adapted to audio or video
